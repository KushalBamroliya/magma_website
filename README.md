# Scroll Animation Canvas

A visually rich, interactive web project demonstrating advanced scroll-based animations using GSAP, Locomotive Scroll, and HTML5 Canvas. Inspired by modern digital experiences, this project showcases smooth scrolling, animated text, and frame-by-frame canvas animations triggered by scroll events.

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling:** Powered by [Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/).
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Built with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/).
- **Canvas Frame Animation:** Multiple sections with frame-by-frame image sequences rendered on `<canvas>`, synced to scroll position.
- **Animated Text:** Headings and paragraphs animate into view as you scroll.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across modern desktop browsers.

## Getting Started


1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
   - No build step required; all dependencies are loaded via CDN.

2. **Assets:**
   - Ensure the `images/` folder contains all required frame images and other assets.
   - Fonts (`jost-variable.ttf`, etc.) should be present in the root directory.


## Customization

- **Images:** Replace or add frame images in the `images/` folder for different canvas animations.
- **Text Content:** Edit headings and paragraphs in `index.html` to fit your project.
- **Colors & Fonts:** Adjust in `style.css` as needed.
